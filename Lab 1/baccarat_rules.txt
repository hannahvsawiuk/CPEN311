Baccarat Game Play Logic
============================

Reset logic
*********************
The game is reset when resetb == 1'b0 (active low) --> when KEY3 is pushed
This resets the state to the starting state and clears all the reg4 card registers.
The reset is ASYNCHRONOUS

Opening actions
*********************
Two cards are dealt to both the player and the dealer face up 
    (first card to the player, second card to dealer, third card to the player, fourth card to the dealer).

The score of each hand is computed.

Game Logic
*********************
If (player’s hand's score == 8 or 9 OR dealer’s hand score == 8 or 9)
    game ends: called a “natural”
    whoever has the higher score wins (if the scores are the same, it is a tie)
Else if (the player’s score from their first two cards == [0, 5])
    player gets third card = yes
    case(dealer's score from first two cards) // does the dealer get a third card logic
        7: dealer gets third card = no;
        6: dealer gets third card = (player's third card face value == (6 or 7)) ? yes : no;             
        5: dealer gets third card = (player's third card face value == (4, 5, 6, or 7)) ? yes : no;
        4: dealer gets third card = (player's third card face value == (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7)) ? yes : no; 
        3: dealer gets third card = (player's third card face value == !8) ? yes : no; (anything but 8) 
        0, 1, or 2: dealer gets third card = yes;
        default: dealer gets third card = no; // can use yes or no for default
Else if (the player’s score from their first two cards == 6 or 7)
    player gets third card = no
    If (the dealer’s score from their first two cards == [0, 5])
        dealer gets third card = yes
    Else 
        dealer gets third card = no

End Game Logic
*********************
// Else (but not needed)
The game is over. 
Scores are computed. 
Whoever has the higher score wins, or if they are the same, it is a tie.
